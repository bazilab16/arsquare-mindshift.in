                                    the patient's progress throughout treatment. They will regularly assess the
                                    patient's
                                    symptoms and goals to ensure that they are making progress. If necessary,
                                    adjustments to
                                    the treatment plan will be made to better cater to the student's needs. By closely
                                    monitoring the student's mental well-being, the clinician can provide comprehensive
                                    support and ensure that the treatment is effective and beneficial. This ongoing
                                    evaluation and monitoring process helps create a safe and supportive environment for
                                    students to discuss their mental health concerns and receive personalized care
                                    openly.
